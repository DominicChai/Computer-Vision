# Computer-Vision
This repo currently includes two tasks in the domain of computer vision: Image Segmentation By thresholding and Image Stitching

## Image Segmentation By thresholding
Computer vision techniques are fruitfully applied in microscopy with applications to areas such as microbiology, electronics, and material science. Micrography represents a simplified domain where we can automate parts of the quality control process. Cast iron is a widely used but brittle material, and this brittleness can be reduced by adding a large amount of carbon to the molten iron. Our aim for this part of the assignment is to develop an automated method for counting graphite (carbon) flakes in micrographs of ductile iron. 

Alogrithms Used:
1. Adaptive Thresholding by Otsuâ€™s algorithm
2. Two-pass Connected Component algorithm

## Image Stitching
Alogrithms Used:
1. RANSAC(Random Sample Consensus)
2. SIFT and SURF in Feature Extraction
3. Homography Estimation
